#RallyPoint Front End Hiring Test: No Ember

This is a repository containing assets and resources for a hiring test at RallyPoint Networks, designed for developers who don't have prior ember experience. If you _do_ have prior Ember experience, consider taking the [Ember Version](https://github.com/RallyPointNetworks/hiring-test-fe-ember) of this test.

##Fields
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Field Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top">firstName</td>
        <td valign="top">String</td>
        <td valign="top">First name of customer</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top">lastName</td>
        <td valign="top">String</td>
        <td valign="top">Last name of customer</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top">dueMonthly</td>
        <td valign="top">Integer</td>
        <td valign="top">Amount in dollars (rounded) the customer owes us each month.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

##Requirements
  - Create a UI to search for customers.
  - You must be able to search all three fields.
  - How the results are displayed and styling rules are, for this exercise, up to you.
  - Tests are not required. Which isn't to say you shouldn't write them. How many tests? Up to you.
    <p>Good luck!</p>

##Process
  - Fork this repository to your account and clone to your desktop. Create a branch for your work.
  - Make whatever changes and additions you deem needed. 
  - When you're done, make a pull request back to our repo.

##For your consideration:
  - Most work we do is usually specced out design wise very well, and you will not be left to make design decisions. The purpose of keeping this open ended here is to let those of you with design chops the opportunity to show them off. Lack of design skills is <em>not</em> a disqualifying factor.
  - Although you will not be forced to do design work, your input will be welcomed and appreciated. Ours is a broad, open team. Everyone has a voice. Feel free to have a voice about your efforts, and about this test. We're all in this together. That's a RallyPoint core value.
  - We use ember at RallyPoint, and are unlikely to change that in the near future. Even if you don't know any ember, you might want to give it a a go. If we know you are unfamiliar, we will probably be imppressed more by the effort than deterred by the lack of specific expertise. The choice is yours.
  - If you want to take the ember path, you can find it [over here](https://github.com/RallyPointNetworks/hiring-test-fe-ember).
